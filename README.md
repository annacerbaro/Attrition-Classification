# Attrition-Classification

## Project Overview
To explore the complete project with interactive visualizations, please visit: [Statistical-Analysis-Attrition-Classification](https://annacerbaro.github.io/Attrition-Classification/).
Our primary goal is to address the challenge of employee attrition, seeking to predict and understand the reasons behind employees leaving their jobs.
Employee attrition is a significant concern for companies, often resulting in increased costs and workplace disruptions. Our project is dedicated to predicting attrition and gaining insights into the underlying factors driving it.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
We've incorporated an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) phase into our project. This step involves scrutinizing the dataset to uncover patterns, relationships, and factors that influence employee attrition.

## Classification
Our project's core focus is the application of various classification techniques. These include Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA), and k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). Through these methods, we aim to effectively predict attrition.
